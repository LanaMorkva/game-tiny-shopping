# Tiny Shopping

This game was developed as a practical project in the Game Programming Lab course. The course aims to provide hands-on experience in game development and design, applying theoretical concepts in a real-world context. It also focuses on enhancing project management, communication, and teamwork skills.

### Task description

The course organizers assigned us the theme of *Grocery Store*, with a specific focus on *Fruits and Vegetables*, for our game project. We were required to develop the game exclusively in C# using the Monogame framework, without relying on advanced game engines. Beyond these constraints, we had complete creative freedom and independently managed the entire development process.

### Overview

*Tiny Shopping* is a multiplayer strategy game where players must acquire and manage resources to ensure the survival of their colony. Players can choose to lead either an ant or termite colony, directing their units to gather resources and engage in battles using various pheromone trails.
